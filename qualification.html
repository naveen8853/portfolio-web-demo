                            As a second-year college student, I am enthusiastic about sharing my educational journey and the strides I've made in pursuit of excellence. Currently enrolled in the Mern-Full Stack program at Saveetha Engineering college,Cloud Computing in NPTEL And Java Program in Skill Vertex, I am developing a strong foundation in Programming Subjects that drives my curiosity and passion for learning.
                            I believe in a well-rounded education, which is why I actively engage in extracurricular activities such as a Footballer that enhance my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills.
                            As I continue to progress in my academic journey, I am excited to leverage the skills and insights I've gained to contribute meaningfully to future projects.
